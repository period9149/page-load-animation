# page-load-animation
Three autonomous page loading animations.

#### This is a set of web page loading animation components I made, including text loading animation, ball rotation loading animation and ball bounce loading animation.

Here are the main points:
 - Use 2D transformations in CSS3 to achieve animation effects.
 - Motion animation-delay for more interesting animations.
 
 Thanks for watching!
